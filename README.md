The purpose of this project is to remake the mobile arcade videogame Space Dodger using the C and Assembly programming languages under the MIPS32 architecture.

The game will only have one level. Once the game starts, the player will use a customer spaceship and his mission will be to dodge all incoming enemies and objects until he is able to reach the portal that will lead to victory. The player will have 3 lives, each life is lost whenever the player collisions with an enemy or object. If the player's lives reach 0, it's game over.

## Installation

```sh
cd SpaceDodger-MIPS32/src
